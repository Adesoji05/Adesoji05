👋 Hi, I’m (Oke Adesoji Tunmise) OAT Analytics. I’m passionate about finding stories hidden in data and using them to drive impact.
👀 My interests? All things data! From SQL and Power BI to creating dashboards and visualizations, I love turning raw numbers into clear, actionable insights.
🌱 Right now, I’m diving into R programming and leveling up my Python skills to bring even more depth to my analysis.
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on data-driven projects where we can create meaningful visualizations, build out dashboards, or solve business challenges together.
